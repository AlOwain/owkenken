## Optimization Ideas

- Memoization
  - According to (Michael Heyeck)[http://www.mlsite.net/neknek/], there is something to be memoized; although I can not figure out exactly what it is.
- Bitvecs
  - The domain could be a bitmap
- Parallelism
  - Multithreading is immediately applicable via recursion.
- Na√Øvete
  - Instead of recalculating the entire domain at each move, you can invalidate rows or columns.
  - Use MRV with LCV for the value

# Notes

- Benchmark the effect of using a u16 instead of a u8
  - Cache misses are probably higher
  - Memory required is higher
  - Conversion between the types probably costs a bit more
- To compare any two domain pruning algorithms
  - The more inclusive one will always be slower,
  - The correctness of the exclusive algorithm can be proven by checking if the problem is:
    1. Still solvable
    2. If not solvable then the difference in the domain must not exclude any valid states.
